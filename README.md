# NEM12toPVoutput

What do I want to do?

The simple one is to upload the daily export amounts.

The slightly more complex idea is to upload the half hourly updates.

There's a bulk uploader too that I should look at.

Need to get the API key from a config file or the command line.

The system ID too?

The file to process should be on the command line.

date range?
